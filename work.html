                <main> <p>Melba Roy Mouton works.Melba Roy Mouton worked at Army Map Service and the Census Bureau,which focused on the plotting of future neighborhoods and other places of population expansion, an incredibly important job during the famous ‘baby boom’ of the post-World War II era in the United States of America.  

                  Her work analyzing statistics of populations showed an aptitude for  interpreting data in a format easy for other scientists and engineers to understand. Then she moved on to NASA.At NASA, she received an Apollo Achievement Award Her work analyzing statistics of populations showed an aptitude for  interpreting data in a format easy for other scientists and engineers to understand. Her initial focus was Echo 1, one of the first satellites used to orbit Earth in order to help communications across the globe.Namely, her abilities made her a prime candidate to work with programming languages, such as APL, one of the first languages used in code, a new technology necessary when working with complex mechanics, space launches, and plotting orbits.She got promoted. Her new role as Assistant Chief of Research Programs at NASA’s Trajectory and Geodynamics Division. Roy Mouton was asked to lead classes on coding, just as she had managed and trained the human computers at NASA. Roy Mouton retired from NASA in 1973,
